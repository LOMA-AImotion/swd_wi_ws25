  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Exercise 1 — Sets (runtime experiment)\n","We want to compare how fast membership tests (using `in`) are for a list and for a set.\n","\n","Key ideas (in simple words):\n","- A list remembers items in a sequence. To check if `x` is in a list, Python may need to\n","  look through many items — this gets slower when the list gets bigger.\n","- A set remembers items in a special way so that Python can usually decide very quickly\n","  if something is in it or not.\n","\n","In many languages, sets behave closer to logarithmic or even constant time on average.\n","In Python specifically, sets are hash-based and give near-constant average-time lookups.\n","Either way, sets scale much better than lists for `in`-checks.\n","\n","What we will do:\n","1) Create random numbers without replacement (no duplicates) using `random.sample`.\n","2) Build a list and a set from the same numbers.\n","3) Measure how long it takes to check 1000 random membership tests using `in`.\n","4) Repeat for sizes 10 000, 100 000, 500 000, 1 000 000 and compare.\n"]},
