    "## Exercise 1 — Sets (runtime experiment)\n",
    "We want to compare how fast membership tests (using 'in') are for a list and for a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas (in simple words):\n",
    "- A list remembers items in a sequence. To check if x is in a list, Python may need to look through many items — this gets slower when the list gets bigger.\n",
    "- A set remembers items in a special way so that Python can usually decide very quickly if something is in it or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, sets are hash-based and give very fast (near-constant average-time) lookups. Lists get slower linearly as they grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do:\n",
    "1) Create random numbers without replacement (no duplicates) using random.sample.\n",
    "2) Build a list and a set from the same numbers.\n",
    "3) Measure how long it takes to check 1000 random membership tests using 'in'.\n",
    "4) Repeat for sizes 10 000, 100 000, 500 000, 1 000 000 and compare.\n"
